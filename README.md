# Image_Stegnography_System
A web-based application that securely hides secret messages in images using LSB and DCT techniques, enhanced with a machine learning steganalysis module to detect hidden data. Built using Python, Flask, and ML models.
This project implements a secure and intelligent image steganography system that allows users to hide confidential messages inside images using Least Significant Bit (LSB) and Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) techniques.
To enhance security, the system integrates a machine learning–based steganalysis module that detects whether an image contains hidden information.
The application is developed as a Flask-based web app with an intuitive interface, combining data hiding, cryptography, and artificial intelligence in a single platform.
